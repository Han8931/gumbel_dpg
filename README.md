# Discrete deterministic policy gradient with Gumbel.
Blog post: how to do deterministic policy gradient with gumbel softmax and why you should do it.

Read us [[here]](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yandexdataschool/gumbel_dpg/blob/master/gumbel_dpg_tutorial.ipynb)!

To reproduce, you will need [theano+lasagne](http://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html#bleeding-edge-version) and [gym](https://gym.openai.com/). We have a dockerfile in the repo if you prefer containers.
